# MFOSmod

This is a collection of modules from Ray Wilson's [Music From Outer Space](http://musicfromouterspace.com/).

I will be using SMT in all the places I can, and replacing obsolete components that cant be found in the usual electronic distributors ( mouser or digikey ), with appropiate ones, following if possible Ray Wilson's advice on parts.

## MFOS SUPER-Modular Bundle

The idea is to end with all the modules from the supermodular bundle for starters, once we have all this modules we can look into transcripting other modules.

TODO:

 [x] 1. VCO
 [] 2. State Variable 12dB/Oct VCF
 [] 3. ADSR Envelope Generator
 [] 4. Mini-Controller
 [] 5. Dual Log/lin VCA
 [] 6. VC Low Frequency Oscillator
 [] 7. Dual AR Envelope Generator
 [] 8. Noise Cornucopia
 [] 9. Four Channel Stereo Panning Mixer
 [] 10. Delayed Modulation Module
 [] 11. Sample & Hold
 [] 12. Sonic Multiplier
 [] 13. Low Pass 24db/OCT VCF
 [] 14. Wave Freaker
 [] 15. Stereo Auto-Panner
 [] 16. Multi-Function Module
 [] 17. MFOS 8 Stage Phase Shifter
 [] 18. MFOS Voltage Quantizer


You dont really need all this modules to make a working synthesizer, but I am planning to make all the modules in KiCAD and start bulding them progresivly.
